### **Summary:**

Multiple critical billing system errors have been observed:

#### 1. Non-Cash Payment Methods Failing:

Non-cash payment methods (Card and Bank Transfer) are currently failing with the error:

> 400: {"error":"Invalid payment method"}

#### 2. Invoices Not Displayed or Recognized:

* Successfully created invoices are not showing up in the dashboard or invoice management tab.
* After generating an invoice and processing payment, returning to the same patient shows the services as pending again — as though no invoice exists.
* The system does not recognize that billing was completed and allows duplicate or redundant invoice creation.

#### 3. No Option to Print Receipt After Payment:

* After successful invoice creation and payment, the system shows a "Payment Processed" notification (e.g., Receipt #RCP-2025-1787), but there is no option to preview or print the receipt.
* Users need a way to reprint or download receipts for patients immediately after payment.

### **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create an invoice for a patient (e.g., Richard Guobadia or Test Patient).
2. Complete payment and observe success message (e.g., "Receipt generated").
3. Return to the patient billing tab — system still allows re-billing same services.
4. Go to Billing Dashboard → Invoice Management → No invoices found.
5. Attempt card or transfer payment → error 400: Invalid payment method.
6. No visible button or link appears to print the receipt after successful payment.

### **Impact:**

* Duplicate service billing and payment processing risk
* Loss of invoice visibility on billing dashboard
* Financial records do not reflect true outstanding or collected amounts
* No proof of payment available for patients or audit trail
