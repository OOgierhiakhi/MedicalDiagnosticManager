**Developer Bug Ticket: Non-Cash Payment Methods Failing (400 Error) and Invoice Visibility Failure**

**Ticket ID:** ERP-BILLING-20250611-001
**Date:** 11th June 2025
**Module:** Payment Processing & Invoice Management
**Environment:** Replit ERP - Production/Test Instance
**Reported By:** Dr. Ogierhiakhi Omokaro

### **Summary:**

Multiple critical billing system errors have been observed:

#### 1. Non-Cash Payment Methods Failing:

Non-cash payment methods (Card and Bank Transfer) are currently failing with the error:

> 400: {"error":"Invalid payment method"}

#### 2. Invoices Not Displayed or Recognized:

* Successfully created invoices are not showing up in the dashboard or invoice management tab.
* After generating an invoice and processing payment, returning to the same patient shows the services as pending again — as though no invoice exists.
* The system does not recognize that billing was completed and allows duplicate or redundant invoice creation.

These errors affect payment collection, reporting accuracy, and audit integrity.

### **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create an invoice for a patient (e.g., Richard Guobadia).
2. Complete payment and observe success message (e.g., "Receipt generated").
3. Return to the patient billing tab — system still allows re-billing same services.
4. Go to Billing Dashboard → Invoice Management → No invoices found.
5. Attempt card or transfer payment → error 400: Invalid payment method.

### **Impact:**

* Duplicate service billing and payment processing risk
* Loss of invoice visibility on billing dashboard
* Financial records do not reflect true outstanding or collected amounts
* Staff confusion due to inconsistent system behavior

### **Action Required:**

* [ ] Fix the 400 error for non-cash payments (as per original ticket)
* [ ] Investigate why invoices do not persist or display in the dashboard and management tab
* [ ] Ensure that once an invoice is created:

  * It is saved correctly in the backend
  * It is visible under Invoice Management
  * It prevents re-selection or re-billing of the same services for the same visit unless canceled
* [ ] Ensure payment processing updates invoice status to "Paid" and hides from "Pending" lists
* [ ] Check if service-to-invoice linkage is broken or not recorded properly

### **Regression Testing Checklist (Post Fix):**

* [ ] Card and Bank Transfer payments processed successfully
* [ ] All invoices appear in Invoice Management tab and dashboard counts
* [ ] Previously billed services do not reappear as new or unbilled
* [ ] Collected Today and Outstanding Amount totals reflect real-time data
* [ ] Duplicate invoice creation blocked unless manually triggered
* [ ] Payment receipts and logs remain intact and accurate

### **Post-Resolution Deliverables:**

* [ ] Summary of root cause
* [ ] Code diff or commit reference
* [ ] Confirmation of no impact on other billing modules
* [ ] Suggest automated test or invoice audit logic to prevent recurrence
