Prompt:
You are working on a web-based ERP system for a diagnostic center, built on Replit using Node.js, PostgreSQL, and frontend frameworks.

Several new and existing issues have been identified. You are to address **each issue below**, ensure correct functionality, and guarantee **no loss of previously working features** across billing, dashboard, lab workflow, and scheduling modules.

🚩 LIST OF ISSUES TO FIX:

1. **Payment Methods Today Not Updating**
   - Ensure all successful transactions (POS, cash, transfer) made today are correctly reflected in the “Payment Methods Today” report.
   - Fix the query or logic that groups transactions by payment method.
   - Use server-side timestamps to ensure consistency.

2. **Collected Today Value Mismatch**
   - The “Collected Today” total does not match the total displayed on the home dashboard.
   - Audit how the dashboard fetches its summary totals. Confirm it pulls **only today’s confirmed payments**, not all-time totals or unapproved payments.

3. **Lab Status Metrics Not Updating**
   - Pending, In Progress, and Completed counts in the lab dashboard are stale or static.
   - Ensure real-time or interval-based refresh is applied.
   - Trigger count update after:
     - Test is marked as received
     - Result is entered or approved
     - Status is updated

4. **Ultrasound Study Schedule Tab Shows Invalid Date**
   - On the Ultrasound tab, scheduled times show “Invalid Date.”
   - Fix datetime formatting — ensure ISO 8601 or UTC format is parsed correctly.
   - Use `toLocaleString()` or date formatting libraries like Day.js or Moment.js.

5. **Start Study Button Not Working**
   - When clicking “Start Study” on an imaging request, nothing happens.
   - Confirm if:
     - Button is wired to a valid `onclick()` handler
     - The action correctly updates the study status (e.g., from “Scheduled” to “In Progress”)
     - Proper user permissions are enforced

6. **Specimen Collection Shown in Non-Lab Units**
   - In units like Imaging, ECG, or Echo, the UI wrongly shows “Specimen Collection” stage.
   - Apply conditional logic to hide specimen-related steps for non-laboratory services.

🛡 REGRESSION SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:

For each fix above, test and confirm the following before deployment:

- ✅ Existing invoices and billing workflows continue to work
- ✅ Payments already processed still appear in reports
- ✅ Dashboard values still auto-update across shifts
- ✅ Lab orders still follow the full result entry workflow
- ✅ Imaging and Echo tabs retain service details and submission options
- ✅ Audit logs, printouts, and receipt functions are unaffected

Run the full test suite after all changes, and generate a bug-resolution summary log.

After implementation, respond with:
- What was changed
- Which files or components were touched
- Confirmation of regression testing
- Any future risks or edge cases observed
