Prompt:
You are debugging the payment processing module in a diagnostic ERP application built on Replit. As of today, non-cash payment options (Card and Bank Transfer) are failing during payment submission with the following error:

> 400: {"error":"Invalid payment method"}

The issue is **new**, and these same payment methods were working correctly yesterday. The breakdown only affects **non-cash payments**, while **cash payments are still processed successfully**.

### Objective:
- Identify and resolve the root cause of this 400 error for card and bank transfer payments.
- Restore full payment functionality for all payment types.

---

### Details to Investigate:

1. **Frontend Validation**
   - Ensure the correct value (`"card"`, `"bank_transfer"`, etc.) is being sent from the form’s `paymentMethod` field.
   - Confirm that radio buttons are passing the exact expected enum/string to the backend.

2. **Backend Controller/Route**
   - Check the backend payment processor for recent changes that could affect how payment method values are parsed or matched.
   - Confirm that non-cash methods are still allowed and mapped correctly in the switch/case or condition block.

3. **Allowed Values List**
   - Verify if a new schema or enum was introduced in the database, validation schema (e.g., Joi/Zod), or backend controller that may have restricted or renamed allowed values.

4. **Version Control Diff**
   - Review yesterday’s working version of the payment logic and compare it to the current version.
   - Identify any code or config changes pushed within the last 24 hours affecting:
     - `payment-method-options`
     - API route validation
     - Defaulting logic
     - Case sensitivity

### Regression Safety Requirements:

✅ Confirm that:
- Cash, Card, and Bank Transfer payment methods all work reliably
- Payment records are saved with the correct method and bank account
- Dashboard summaries reflect updated totals by method
- No duplicate or corrupted entries are created
- All previously working invoices remain payable
- Reports and receipt logs still function as expected

### Deliverable:
After fixing the issue, document:
- The cause of the 400 error
- What was changed to resolve it
- Any residual risks or related components affected
- Regression checklist completed
