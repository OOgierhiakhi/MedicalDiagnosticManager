Prompt:
You are maintaining a medical diagnostic ERP application on Replit. A critical error occurs during payment processing. When attempting to process a payment for an already generated invoice, the system returns:

500: {"message":"Failed to process payment"}

Steps to reproduce:
1. Select services and generate an invoice (e.g., INV-202506-0065013 or INV-202506-0066414).
2. Navigate to the payment page.
3. Select a payment method (e.g., POS/Card Payment or Cash Payment).
4. Click "Pay".
5. The payment fails with a 500 error message.

Objective:
Fix this payment processing error and ensure the system allows the user to:
- Select an unpaid invoice
- View its associated services
- Enter payment method and complete payment without reselecting services

Technical Requirements:
1. Investigate and resolve the root cause of the 500 server error. Log the exact backend error message or stack trace.
2. Ensure invoice IDs are being correctly passed to the payment handler or endpoint.
3. Prevent null or undefined service list submissions when the invoice is already populated.
4. Ensure the `InvoiceID`, `AmountToPay`, and `BankAccount` fields are properly passed and validated.

Regression Protection:
Before finalizing this fix, test and confirm that:
✅ Previously working functionalities — such as invoice creation, service selection, subtotal/totals, and invoice listing — continue to work as expected  
✅ No duplicate invoices or service re-selections are triggered  
✅ Completed payments update invoice status to “Paid”  
✅ Audit logs or receipts are still generated and saved  
✅ The user can resume payment mid-process without starting over  

Final Test Flow:
- Create a new invoice
- Pay using POS/Card method
- Pay using Cash method
- Attempt to pay a completed invoice (should block or warn)
- Confirm invoice status updates correctly after payment

Once resolved, notify of the correction and show updated status flow for invoice + payment.
