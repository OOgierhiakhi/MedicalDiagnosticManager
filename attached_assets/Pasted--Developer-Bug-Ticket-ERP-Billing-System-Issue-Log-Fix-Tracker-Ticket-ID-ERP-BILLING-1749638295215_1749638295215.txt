## üîí RESOLVED AND LOCKED (Do Not Alter Unless Broken)

The following issues have been fixed, tested, and are considered stable:

1. ‚úÖ **Non-cash payment methods (Card and Transfer)** were failing with `400: Invalid payment method`. This has been resolved.
2. ‚úÖ **Invoices now persist** in the Invoice Management tab and are reflected in the dashboard summary.
3. ‚úÖ **Duplicate invoice creation** for already billed services was fixed by properly linking invoice status to services.

**Do not re-edit or overwrite these unless an error is explicitly reported.**

## üîß OPEN / PENDING ISSUES (To Be Fixed)

The following issues remain unresolved and should be addressed without modifying previously fixed modules:

### 1. Invoice Workflow Behavior Is Incorrect

* The "Create Invoice" button currently processes payments directly, skipping the invoice preview or confirmation phase.
* Expected behavior: "Create Invoice" should generate a pending invoice and list the patient under the payment tab, allowing payment to be processed separately.
* Action: Restore proper two-step workflow ‚Äî billing first, then payment.

### 2. Missing Receipt Print/Download Option After Payment

* After "Payment Processed" notification (e.g., `#RCP-2025-1787`), no button or link is available to view or print the receipt.
* Action: Add a clickable button to preview/download receipt immediately after payment, and enable reprint from invoice history.

### 3. Receipt Copy Configuration Required

* A single receipt is currently generated.
* Action: Design receipt layout with multiple labeled copies:

  * "Patient Copy"
  * "Cashier Copy"
  * One copy per service unit included in the invoice (e.g., Lab, Imaging, ECG).
* The receipt print prompt should include options to **Print** or **Cancel**, before triggering the print dialog.
* **Enhancement:** Replace the passive "Payment Processed" toast with a messagebox/dialog that includes:

  * Receipt ID
  * Payment summary
  * Buttons: "Print Receipt", "Cancel"

### 4. Lab Status and Home Dashboard Totals Not Updating

* Collected Today and Total Outstanding do not always reflect real-time payments.
* Lab test status metrics are not refreshing across tabs (Pending, In Progress, Completed).
* Action: Rebind or refresh metrics after new entries or status changes.

### 5. Invalid Date in Imaging (Ultrasound) Tab

* The appointment schedule shows ‚ÄúInvalid Date‚Äù in the study time field.
* Action: Fix date parsing logic (likely incorrect datetime format or undefined timestamp).

### 6. Start Study Button Not Functioning in Imaging

* Clicking "Start Study" does not trigger status transition.
* Action: Check JS/React handlers or missing API linkage to study status.

### 7. Specimen Collection Step Displayed in Non-Lab Services

* Specimen collection prompt is incorrectly shown in ECG, Echo, and Ultrasound units.
* Action: Conditionally hide this step for all non-laboratory service types.

### 8. Invoice Management Filter and Search Not Working

* Filtering invoices by status (e.g., "Unpaid") shows no results despite existing invoices.
* Patient/invoice search field returns empty even for known values.
* Action: Verify and fix frontend filter binding and backend query logic.

### 9. Service Names Not Displayed in Invoice Breakdown

* Service names are replaced with generic "Service" labels in the invoice detail view.
* Action: Map and display actual service names from the invoice items list.

### 10. Today's Date Missing from Invoices Created Today

* Invoices created on the current day do not show the correct timestamp or appear outdated.
* Action: Validate date formatting and ensure timestamps are stored in local time or displayed using `toLocaleDateString()`.

### 11. Multiple Duplicate Services and Zero Pricing in Invoice

* Even when only one service is selected during billing, the system duplicates it multiple times in the invoice.
* Unit prices are not retrieved for the services, resulting in a total of ‚Ç¶0.
* **Urgent Concern:** This is a **critical billing logic failure** that undermines invoice integrity and financial records.
* Action: Investigate and fix the root cause of:

  * Service duplication
  * Missing or zeroed-out unit price values
  * Broken linkage between selected service and invoice item data
* Note from reporter: *‚ÄúThis is frustrating. I selected just one test for a patient, and the system created multiple zero-priced entries, forcing me to manually correct what should be automatic. This is a basic and critical feature that must not break.‚Äù*

## ‚úÖ Development Guidance

To prevent regression:

* **Retain all resolved functions exactly as they are** unless re-opened.
* Use version control or backup snapshots before applying new changes.
* Verify database writes, backend API routing, and UI state updates independently.
