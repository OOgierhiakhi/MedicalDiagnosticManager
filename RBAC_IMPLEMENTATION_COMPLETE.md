# Secure Role-Based Access Control System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Orient Medical Diagnostic Center now features a comprehensive enterprise-grade Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with granular permissions, audit trails, and professional management interfaces.

## System Architecture

### Database Schema (shared/rbac-schema.ts)
- **Roles**: Multi-tenant role definitions with hierarchy levels
- **Permissions**: Granular permissions with resource-action mapping
- **Role Permissions**: Many-to-many relationship with conditional access
- **User Roles**: User assignment to roles with branch-specific access
- **Security Events**: Comprehensive audit trail and security monitoring
- **Security Policies**: Configurable security rules and enforcement

### Backend Implementation

#### RBAC Storage Layer (server/rbac-storage.ts)
- Complete CRUD operations for all RBAC entities
- Advanced permission checking with conditional logic
- Security event logging and audit trail management
- Role hierarchy and inheritance handling
- Performance-optimized queries with proper indexing

#### RBAC Middleware (server/rbac-middleware.ts)
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Permission validation with resource-specific checks
- Security event logging for all access attempts
- Rate limiting and security policy enforcement

#### RBAC Seeding (server/rbac-seed.ts)
- Automated creation of default system roles
- Initial permission setup for all system resources
- Super admin role with full system access
- Branch-specific role configurations

### Frontend Implementation

#### Role Management Interface (client/src/pages/role-management.tsx)
- Professional data grid for role management
- Create, edit, and delete roles with permission assignment
- Real-time permission matrix visualization
- Role hierarchy management with level indicators
- Bulk operations and advanced filtering

#### Security Audit Dashboard (client/src/pages/security-audit.tsx)
- Comprehensive security event monitoring
- Real-time security metrics and analytics
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Security trend analysis with visual indicators
- Automated threat detection alerts

## Database Tables

### Core RBAC Tables
- `roles` - Role definitions with hierarchy
- `permissions` - System permissions catalog
- `role_permissions` - Role-permission assignments
- `user_roles` - User-role assignments
- `security_events` - Security audit trail
- `security_policies` - Security configuration

### Integration Points

- Multi-tenant support via `tenants` table
- Branch-specific permissions via `branches` table
- Session tracking integration

## Security Policies

### Access Control
- Resource-based permission checking
- Action-specific authorization
- Conditional access logic
- Role hierarchy enforcement

### Audit Requirements
- All security events logged
- Failed access attempts tracked
- Administrative actions audited
- Session activities monitored

### Compliance Features
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Security event retention
- Access pattern analysis
- Compliance reporting support

## Usage Examples

### Protecting Routes
```typescript
app.get("/api/patients", 
  requirePermission("read", "patients"), 
  async (req, res) => {
    // Route implementation
  }
);
```

### Frontend Permission Checking
```typescript
const { hasPermission } = usePermissions();

if (hasPermission("write", "patients")) {
  // Show edit button
}
```

### Role Creation
```typescript
const newRole = await rbacStorage.createRole({
  name: "Lab Technician",
  description: "Laboratory staff role",
  level: 3,
  tenantId: 1
});
```
