## Method 1: Manual Table List (Simplest)

Since VBA isn't working, manually check your Access database:

1. **Open Access Navigation Pane** (left side)
2. **Look for "Tables" section**
3. **Right-click each table** → View → Design View
4. **Note table names with substantial record counts**

Based on what you've told me:
- tblRecPatient Register: 9,319 records ✓
- ftblBiLfinancialtransactions: 20,771 records ✓

## Method 2: Direct Export Without Analysis

**Step A: Export Patient Table**
1. Open "tblRecPatient Register" table
2. File → Export → External Data → Text File
3. Browse to save location, name it `patients.csv`
4. Click "Export with formatting and layout"
5. Choose "Delimited" → Next
6. Select "Comma" delimiter → Next  
7. Check "Include field names on first row" → Next
8. Click "Finish"

**Step B: Export Financial Table**
1. Open "ftblBiLfinancialtransactions" table
2. File → Export → External Data → Text File
3. Browse to save location, name it `financial.csv`
4. Click "Export with formatting and layout"
5. Choose "Delimited" → Next
6. Select "Comma" delimiter → Next
7. Check "Include field names on first row" → Next
8. Click "Finish"

## Method 3: Query-Based Export

If direct export fails, create queries:

1. **Create New Query in Design View**
2. **Add tblRecPatient Register table**
3. **Select All Fields (*)**
4. **Run Query**
5. **Export Query Results as CSV**

Repeat for financial table.

## Method 4: Copy-Paste Approach

For smaller subsets:
1. **Open table in datasheet view**
2. **Select all data** (Ctrl+A)
3. **Copy** (Ctrl+C)
4. **Paste into Excel**
5. **Save as CSV**

## Method 5: External Tools

If Access export continues failing:
- **Use Microsoft Access Database Engine**
- **Try Excel's Data → Get External Data → From Access**
- **Use ODBC connection** to read Access data

## Recommended Next Steps

Given your substantial dataset (30,090+ records), I recommend:

1. **Try Method 2 first** - Direct CSV export
2. **If that fails, use Method 3** - Query-based export
3. **Upload CSV files** to the migration interface
4. **I'll handle field mapping** and data transformation

Which method would you like to try first? The direct export (Method 2) usually works most reliably.
