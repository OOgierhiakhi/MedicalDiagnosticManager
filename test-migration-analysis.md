# Orient Medical Centre - Cleaned Database Migration Analysis

## Database File Details
- **File**: cleaned_orient_database.accdb
- **Size**: 767KB (significantly reduced from original)
- **Status**: Successfully downloaded and ready for analysis
- **Google Drive Link**: https://drive.google.com/file/d/157We6wi6BcOiuxJQVKImBApaZbBiv6aM/view?usp=sharing

## Migration Testing Process

### Phase 1: Database Structure Analysis
The cleaned database has been successfully prepared by removing unused hospital system tables and focusing on diagnostic center operations.

### Phase 2: Key Tables Expected (Based on Previous Analysis)
Based on our earlier analysis of the original database, the cleaned version should contain:

**Core Operational Tables:**
- `tblRecPatient Register` - 9,319 patient records
- `ftblBiLfinancialtransactions` - 20,771 financial transactions  
- `tblTests` - Available test procedures
- `tblTestCategories` - Test categorization
- `tblReferralProviders` - Referral partner information

**Supporting Tables:**
- User management tables
- Configuration tables
- Reference data tables

### Phase 3: Migration Validation Points

1. **Patient Data Integrity**
   - Verify all 9,319+ patient records migrate correctly
   - Validate patient ID generation and uniqueness
   - Check referral source tracking

2. **Financial Transaction Accuracy**
   - Ensure all 20,771+ transactions transfer properly
   - Validate payment method tracking
   - Verify transaction amounts and dates

3. **Test Management**
   - Confirm test catalog migration
   - Validate test pricing structure
   - Check test-patient associations

4. **Referral System**
   - Verify referral provider data
   - Validate commission tracking setup
   - Check referral-patient relationships

### Phase 4: Data Quality Checks

1. **Completeness**: All critical operational data migrated
2. **Accuracy**: Financial totals match source system
3. **Relationships**: Foreign key relationships maintained
4. **Performance**: Query response times acceptable

## Next Steps

1. Use the migration interface to upload and analyze the cleaned database
2. Generate field mapping templates for each table
3. Execute controlled migration with validation checkpoints
4. Perform comprehensive data verification
5. Generate migration completion report

## Expected Outcomes

- Complete operational continuity from Access to PostgreSQL ERP
- Zero data loss during migration
- Maintained referral tracking and commission calculations
- Accurate financial reporting capabilities
- Improved system performance and scalability
