**✅ READY FOR YOUR ACCESS DATABASE EXAMINATION**

The application source code is completely saved and deployment-ready. I'm now prepared to examine your Access database backend, identify the populated tables with useful data, and work together on preparing the upload strategy.

Please share access to your database so we can:
1. **Analyze the table structure** and identify which tables contain data
2. **Examine data quality** and format requirements
3. **Map Access fields** to ERP database columns
4. **Create selective import** strategy for relevant tables only
5. **Test with sample data** before full migration

Ready when you are!
