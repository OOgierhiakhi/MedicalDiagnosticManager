# Orient Medical Centre - Discovery Session

## What I've Observed from Screenshots
- Dashboard shows daily revenue of ₦1,548,010.00 (cash ₦712,050, POS ₦120,000, transfer ₦125,000)
- Patient management system with search functionality
- Real patient data visible: UGWUEGBU JANE, OMOKARO names with demographics
- Current system shows "No patients registered yet" - suggesting fresh start needed

## Critical Questions for Proper Planning

### 1. Current Operations
**What is your daily patient volume?**
- How many patients do you see per day typically?
- What are your peak hours/days?
- How many staff handle patient registration?

**What services do you provide most frequently?**
- Blood tests (FBC, malaria, glucose)?
- Imaging (X-ray, ultrasound)?
- Specialized diagnostics?

### 2. Business Priorities
**What is causing you the biggest operational pain right now?**
- Patient queue management?
- Financial tracking and reporting?
- Referral commission calculations?
- Staff workflow coordination?

**What would success look like for this new system?**
- Faster patient processing?
- Accurate financial reports?
- Better referral partner relationships?

### 3. Workflow Specifics
**Patient Registration Process:**
- Who registers patients (receptionist, nurse, doctor)?
- What information do you absolutely need at registration?
- When do you collect payment (upfront, after service, flexible)?

**Referral Process:**
- How do referral patients identify themselves?
- When do you capture referral source information?
- How do you currently calculate and pay commissions?

### 4. Financial Operations
**Revenue Tracking:**
- Do you need real-time daily totals?
- How do you handle different payment methods?
- What reports do you need (daily, weekly, monthly)?

**Commission Management:**
- How often do you pay referral partners?
- What's your current commission calculation method?
- Do different partners have different rates?

### 5. Data Migration Reality Check
**Your Access Database:**
- Are the 9,315+ patients still active/relevant?
- What's the most critical data to preserve?
- Can you export patient lists to CSV files?
- Do you need historical transaction data or just patient records?

### 6. Implementation Approach
**What's your timeline preference?**
- Need system running immediately for daily operations?
- Can you run parallel with current system for testing?
- Prefer gradual rollout or complete switch?

**Who will use the system daily?**
- Receptionists for patient registration?
- Lab staff for test processing?
- Managers for financial oversight?
- External referral partners for tracking?

## My Recommendation for Next Steps

Based on what I can see, I suggest we focus on:

1. **Core Patient Registration & Billing** (Week 1)
   - Simple patient registration (name, phone, DOB)
   - Test selection and payment processing
   - Basic daily revenue tracking

2. **Referral Integration** (Week 2)
   - Referral source capture during service selection
   - Commission calculation logic
   - Partner management

3. **Data Migration** (Week 3)
   - Import your real patient data from Access
   - Historical transaction preservation
   - System validation with real data

**But first, I need your answers to understand exactly what you need most urgently.**

Which of these questions can you help me understand so I can build the right solution for Orient Medical Centre?
