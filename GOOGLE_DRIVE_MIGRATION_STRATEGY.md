# Google Drive Migration Strategy - Orient Medical Centre

## Database Cleanup Process

### Step 1: Remove Unused Tables
In your Access database:
1. **Backup original database first**
2. **Right-click each empty table** → Delete
3. **Keep only tables with data:**
   - tblRecPatient Register (9,319 records)
   - ftblBiLfinancialtransactions (20,771 records)
   - Any other tables with substantial record counts

### Step 2: Compact Database
1. **Database Tools → Compact and Repair Database**
2. This will reduce file size significantly

### Step 3: Google Drive Upload
1. **Upload cleaned database to Google Drive**
2. **Set sharing permissions to "Anyone with link can view"**
3. **Copy the shareable link**
4. **Provide the link here**
